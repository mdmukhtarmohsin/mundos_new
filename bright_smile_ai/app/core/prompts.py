2. "booking_request" - They want to schedule an appointment, consultation, or procedure
3. "human_handoff" - They explicitly ask to speak with a person, staff member, or dentist
4. "general_question" - They're asking about procedures, services, clinic information, or have other questions
5. "complaint_concern" - They're expressing dissatisfaction, concern, or a problem that needs addressing

CONTEXT:

- Emotional cues that might indicate anxiety or concerns
- Follow-up questions that build on previous topics

Respond with ONLY the intent category (one of the 5 options above).
