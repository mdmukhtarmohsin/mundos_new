# Enhanced AI-Powered Lead Management System

## Overview

The Bright Smile AI system has been significantly enhanced to meet the product requirements for AI-powered lead scanning, intelligent decision making, and aggressive retention offers. This document outlines the new capabilities and how they work together to prevent lead loss and maximize conversion opportunities.

## ðŸš€ New Features Implemented

### 1. AI-Powered Lead Scanning (`RiskAnalyzer.scan_all_leads_for_opportunities`)

**What it does:**
- Actively scans all leads (NEW, ACTIVE, AT_RISK) for engagement opportunities
- Uses AI to determine if proactive outreach would add value
- Identifies leads showing buying signals or needing attention
- Makes intelligent decisions about when and how to engage

**How it works:**
```python
# AI analyzes each lead for opportunities
opportunity_assessment = await risk_analyzer._ai_analyze_lead_opportunity(lead)

if opportunity_assessment["should_engage"]:
    if opportunity_assessment["strategy"] == "proactive_outreach":
        await risk_analyzer._send_proactive_engagement(lead, assessment)
    elif opportunity_assessment["strategy"] == "escalate_to_human":
        # Escalate high-value opportunities to human staff
```

**AI Decision Factors:**
- Lead's original inquiry and service interests
- Conversation history and engagement patterns
- Available offers and testimonials
- Time since last contact
- Current lead status and risk level

### 2. Aggressive Retention Offers (`RiskAnalyzer._send_aggressive_retention_offer`)

**What it does:**
- Automatically sends compelling retention offers to high-risk leads
- Uses AI to generate urgent, value-driven messages
- Addresses specific risk factors identified by the system
- Prevents leads from going cold by offering irresistible incentives

**When it triggers:**
- Lead status changes to AT_RISK
- Risk level becomes HIGH
- Sentiment score drops significantly
- No response after price discussions

**AI Message Generation:**
```python
retention_prompt = f"""
You are a dental practice AI assistant. Create an AGGRESSIVE retention message for a high-risk lead who is about to be lost.

LEAD CONTEXT:
- Name: {lead.name}
- Risk Factors: {', '.join(risk_assessment.get('risk_factors', []))}
- Sentiment Trend: {risk_assessment.get('sentiment_trend', [])}

MESSAGE REQUIREMENTS:
- Be URGENT but not desperate
- Address their specific risk factors
- Present the most compelling offer prominently
- Create a sense of urgency and value
- Make it impossible to ignore
"""
```

### 3. AI-Powered Outreach Strategy Selection (`EngagementEngine._ai_qualify_and_strategize_lead`)

**What it does:**
- Replaces simple rule-based qualification with intelligent AI analysis
- Analyzes each cold lead to determine the best outreach approach
- Selects from multiple strategies: gentle_nudge, social_proof, incentive_offer, or custom
- Considers lead context, available resources, and timing

**Strategy Selection Logic:**
```python
strategy_prompt = f"""
You are an AI marketing expert for a dental practice. Analyze this cold lead and determine the best outreach strategy.

ANALYSIS TASK:
1. Should this lead be contacted? Consider their original interest, time elapsed, and available resources
2. If yes, what's the best outreach strategy?
3. What specific offer or testimonial should be featured?

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
{{
    "should_contact": true/false,
    "strategy": "gentle_nudge", "social_proof", "incentive_offer", or "custom",
    "custom_message": "Custom message if strategy is 'custom', otherwise null",
    "featured_offer": "Specific offer to highlight, if applicable",
    "urgency_level": "low", "medium", or "high"
}}
"""
```

### 4. Comprehensive AI Analysis (`/api/v1/agents/run-comprehensive-analysis`)

**What it does:**
- Combines AI lead scanning and risk analysis in one operation
- Provides complete overview of all AI interventions
- Runs both proactive opportunity identification and reactive risk management
- Gives marketers complete visibility into AI decision making

**API Endpoint:**
```bash
POST /api/v1/agents/run-comprehensive-analysis
Headers: X-API-Key: bright-smile-agent-key
```

**Response:**
```json
